Asymmetric RSA encryption with a key length of 2048 bits is used to organize the end-to-end encryption of your correspondence. 
All correspondence is stored on the server in encrypted form, and is also destroyed after the expiration of the storage time that you selected during registration. 
When registering a temporary mailbox, you can use a QR code to save your username and password.
